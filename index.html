                <h3>LiClipse provides a new experience for Eclipse users.</h3>
                <p>With it, users get out of the box:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved theming support based on new Eclipse 4 improvements</li>
                    <li>A fast editor supporting many languages builtin</li>
                    <li>A simple way to add support for a new language</li>
                    <li>Usability improvements for all Eclipse editors</li>
                    <li>Bundling of many useful plugins in a single package</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Theming support based on Eclipse 4 improvements</h3>
                <p>Colors are not only kept consistent among all editors by using the eclipse-color-theme
                    plugin, but the IDE can also themed as a whole,
                    allowing for dark themes that are kind to your eyes.
                </p>
                <p><img src="images/theming.png"></p>
                <h3>Languages supported</h3>
                <p>LiClipse supports many languages out of the box:</p>
                <p>CoffeScript, C/C++, CSS, Django Templates, HTML, JavaScript, Python, RST, SCSS, XML.</p>
                <p>All those languages feature syntax highlighting, template completion,
                    outline, select/deselect scope, comment/uncomment, auto-indent, linked edition,
                    multi-edition, among others.
                </p>
                <p>As a note, some editors have <strong>improved support:</strong></p>
                <p>The HTML editor has advanced context-based code-completion.</p>
                <p>The HTML, XML and JavaScript editors have code-analysis and code-formatting features.</p>
                <h3>Usability improvements for all Eclipse editors</h3>
                <p>At this point, the major improvement is multi-edition supporting all editors
                    (such as PyDev, JDT, etc).
                </p>
                <p>See: <a href="video/multi_edition_video.html">Multi-Edition Video</a> for details</p>
                <p>Besides the multi-edition (which can be triggered in a Ctrl+K search or with the mouse with
                Ctrl+Alt+Mouse Click), the rectangular edit is also improved to be triggered with
                Alt+Click (and stopped with escape).</p>
                <h3>Bundling of other useful plugins</h3>
                <p>Eclipse has a myriad of useful plugins, but it can be difficult to always keep up-to-date with all
                    of those, besides finding them out can be time-consuming, so, LiClipse bundles the following
                    plugins in a single package: Workspace Mechanic, Eclipse Color Theme, StartExplorer, AnyEdit and PyDev
                    (note that PyDev does not follow the rule of being useful for everyone as the other plugins,
                    but LiClipse itself is based on reusing parts of the PyDev codebase).
