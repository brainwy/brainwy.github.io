            <h1>Getting the code</h1>
            <p>The first thing you probably want to do in order to code in LiClipseText is
                <strong>getting its code</strong>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.6.0, Git and Java 8.0 (note that other
                versions of those should work too but details may differ a bit)
            </p>
            <p>Before getting the code, there's an important step you need to make:
                Change your java 'compiler compliance-level' to 8.0. To do this, go to
                <strong>window &gt; preferences &gt; Java &gt; compiler</strong> and change that setting from
                <strong>1.4 to 1.8</strong>.
            </p>
            <div class="section" id="repository">
                <h2>Repository</h2>
                <p>Get the code with Git from
                    <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fabioz/LiClipseText">https://github.com/fabioz/LiClipseText</a>
                    (ideally, fork it at github, create your own branch at the forked
                    repository -- usually based in the <strong>master</strong> branch -- and later send
                    a pull request on github so that the code can be merged back). Later, if
                    you want to provide some other feature/bugfix, a new branch should be
                    created again.
                </p>
                <p>Then, in Eclipse, go to: <strong>File &gt; Import &gt; Existing projects into
                    workspace</strong> and point it to the root of the repository you just
                    downloaded.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="section" id="configuring-the-environment-after-getting-the-code">
            <h1>Configuring the environment after getting the code</h1>
            <p>Important: Before doing any changes to the code it's important to note
                that you should create a new branch (usually based on the master
                branch) for doing code changes. See:
                <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging</a>
                for details on creating and using branches.
            </p>
            <p>Note that to make sure that LiClipseText keeps working on the long run,
                usually tests are required for pull requests (unless it's a really trivial change).
                Those reside in the project/tests source folder.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="running-it-with-your-changes">
            <h1>Running it with your changes</h1>
            <p>After you download the contents and do changes to the code, you can do a Run As &gt; Eclipse Application and
                a new Eclipse instance will be run with the changes you did.
            </p>

            <h1>Creating a distribution locally</h1>
            <p>Now, on to the build: LiClipseText uses maven to do the build, so, it should be a matter of
                using "mvn install".
            </p>
            <p>There's a bat file at: /features/org.brainwy.liclipsetext.feature/build_liclipsetext.bat
                which can be used as a base to know which environment variables are needed to do a build
                and /pom.xml (in the root) has more details on getting pre-requisites.
