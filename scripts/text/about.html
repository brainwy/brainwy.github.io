        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            LiClipseText was extracted from <a href="http://www.liclipse.com/">LiClipse</a> to provide a lighteight, Open Source (EPL-based),
            Eclipse editor targeting multiple languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was created by Fabio Zadrozny.
        </p>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>
            First, I'm a big supporter of Open Source software. Besides LiClipseText, <a href="http://pydev.org">PyDev</a> is also another
            software which I maintain and extracting LiClipseText from <a href="http://www.liclipse.com/">LiClipse</a> and providing it
            as Open Source is something which I wanted to do for quite some time already.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure, there's a risk that by making it Open Source users will stop supporting its development and just getting it "for free"...
            Personally, I hope this won't happen and expect that LiClipseText users that can will still upgrade to its
            commercial counterpart (<a href="http://www.liclipse.com/">LiClipse</a>) to keep
            its development possible (or will support it through donations).
        </p>
        <h1>What's the difference between LiClipseText and LiClipse?</h1>
    	<p>LiClipseText provides the support for multiple languages as an Eclipse editor.</p>
    	<p><a href="http://www.liclipse.com/">LiClipse</a> is its commercial counterpart, which provides enhancements such as:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Bundling of LiClipseText (along with PyDev, EGit, ColorTheme, AnyEdit and StartExplorer) as a standalone with native installers.</li>
    		<li>Enhancements to the theming (allowing theming of the IDE along with the editor and a nice dark theme).</li>
    		<li>Multiple cursors.</li>
    		<li>Linting for JavaScript, XML and HTML editors.</li>
    		<li>Code formatting for HTML, XML.</li>
    		<li>Vertical Indent Guides.</li>
    		<li>Improved text search capabilities (with Lucene index-based searching, support for external folders, open editors and additional filtering on results page).</li>
    		<li>HTML preview for the RST, Markdown and HTML editors.</li>
    		<li>Debugging of Django Templates in PyDev.</li>
    		<li>Launching of files opened with LiClipseText.</li>
