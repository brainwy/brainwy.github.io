        LiClipse can be downloaded as an update site to be installed on a base Eclipse install or as a native installer (recommended), which provides a pre-configured
        standalone for Windows (32 bits or 64 bits), Mac OS (64 bits) or Linux (32 bits or 64 bits).

        <br/>
        <br/>
        All installers may be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwwQN8QrgsRpLVlDeHRNemw3S1E&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>
        (install instructions below for each platform).

        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's interesting to note that other plugins (such as JDT, CDT, etc.)
        may be installed regularly in LiClipse using the provided update site for such plugins.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Note that for Mac OS 32 bits, the install must be done using the provided update site using a base Eclipse install.
        In this case, it's recommended to download the Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary from
        <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a>
        -- or a different Eclipse based bundle from your choice --
        and install LiClipse as a plugin using the provided update site.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <br/>

        <hr/><h2 id="windows">Native Windows Install</h2>

        Download the .exe file from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwwQN8QrgsRpLVlDeHRNemw3S1E&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive</a> and run it locally, following the installer instructions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note: 64 bits installers, end with x86_64 and 32 bit installers end with x86.
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <br/><hr/><h2 id="macos">Native Mac OS Install</h2>

        Download the .dmg file from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwwQN8QrgsRpLVlDeHRNemw3S1E&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>, mount it as a disk and copy it (drag it) to the Applications dir.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>Important:</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        On latest Mac OS X versions, after extracting the DMG, when executing LiClipse.app, you may get an error such as:
        <br/>
        <br/>

        "LiCLipse.app" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        This happens because LiClipse isn't currently signed or distributed through the Mac App Store.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        To overcome this, right-click the file, choose 'open' and confirm -- instead of double-clicking it (note that
        this must be done only once, subsequent attempts to open with double-click should work properly).
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Alternatively, it's possible to go to <strong>System Preferences > Security & Privacy</strong> and change "<strong>Allow Applications Downloaded
        From</strong>" to "<strong>Anywhere</strong>". You have to click the lock on the bottom to make changes. Once you start up LiClipse.app, you can
        change it back to "Mac App Store and identified developers".
        <br/>
        <br/>

        See: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3662">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3662</a> for details.
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <br/><hr/><h2 id="linux">Native Linux Install</h2>


        Download the .tar.gz from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwwQN8QrgsRpLVlDeHRNemw3S1E&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note: 64 bits installers, end with x86_64 and 32 bit installers end with x86.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Copy it to where you want to install it, unpack it at the chosen dir (where you have permissions) with:
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <strong>tar xfz liclipse_VERSION_linux.gtk.ARCH.tar.gz</strong> (replacing VERSION and ARCH properly)
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Then, create a link to start it using 'liclipse' from anywhere with:
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>sudo ln -s `pwd`/liclipse/LiClipse /usr/bin/liclipse</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        (or alternatively, just execute liclipse/LiClipse)
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <br/><hr/><h2 id="update_site">Update Site Install</h2>

        To use the update site, download the <strong>UPDATE SITE.zip</strong> from
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwwQN8QrgsRpLVlDeHRNemw3S1E&amp;usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>,
        extract it in a folder, then,
        on Eclipse (or a previously downloaded LiClipse) go to:
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>Help > Install New Software</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        and on the dialog add the folder where you extracted the update site contents,
        select all the items and follow the wizard (<strong>note</strong>: you may have to uncheck "<strong>group
        items by category</strong>" in order to see the items to be installed)..
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <h3>Requirement: Eclipse 4.3.1</h3>

        Note that to be installed, LiClipse requires Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) onwards.
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <h3>Requirement: Java 7</h3>

        The installed Eclipse MUST be running with a Java 7 VM, otherwise LiClipse may not show as being installed or you'll have errors such as:<br/>
        <br/>
        java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: SomeClass :<br/>
         Unsupported major.minor version 51.0<br/>
            at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)<br/>
            at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(Unknown Source)<br/>
        <br/>
        -- Note that the native LiClipse installers ship by default with a VM, so, the installed java version shouldn't be a concern.<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>



        <h3>Requirement: uninstall conflicting bundles</h3>

        Note that if you have some of the bundled plugins in Eclipse (i.e.: PyDev, AnyEdit, ColorTheme,
        StartExplorer, WorkspaceMechanic, Egit) you may have to uninstall it before installing LiClipse.
        <br/>
        <br/>


        <br/><hr/><h2 id="updating_native">Updating Native Install</h2>

        To update, 2 options are available:
        <br/>
        <br/>

        1. Download the native installer again and install as a fresh install (but in this case you should install it
        on a different directory or first uninstall the existing version).
        <br/>
        <br/>

        2. Update the current installation with an update site that's more recent following the update site instructions.
        <br/>
