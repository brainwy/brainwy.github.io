        <h3>LiClipse provides a new experience for Eclipse users</h3>
        <p>With it, users get out of the box:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved theming support based on Eclipse 4 improvements</li>
            <li>A fast editor supporting many languages builtin. <a href="languages.html">View supported languages.</a></li>
            <li>A simple way to add support for a new language</li>
            <li>Usability improvements for all Eclipse editors (such as multi-edition and vertical indent guides)</li>
            <li>Bundling of many useful plugins in a single package</li>
            <li>Native installers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Theming support based on Eclipse 4 improvements</h3>
        <p>Bundling of the Eclipse Color Theme plugin helps in keeping colors consistent among all editors,
            and LiClipse applies the color theme chosen to other parts of the IDE,
            allowing for dark themes that are kind to your eyes.
        </p>

        <p><a href="history.html">View highlights for previous releases</a></p>
        <p>All those languages feature syntax highlighting, template completion,
            outline, select/deselect scope, comment/uncomment, auto-indent, linked edition,
            multi-edition, mark occurrences, among others.
        </p>
        <p>As a note, some editors have <strong>improved support:</strong></p>
        <p>The HTML editor has advanced context-based code-completion</p>
        <p>The HTML, XML and JavaScript editors have code-analysis and code-formatting features</p>
        <h3>Usability improvements for all Eclipse editors</h3>
        <p>At this point, the major improvement is multi-edition and vertical indent guides, supporting all editors
            (such as PyDev, JDT, etc).
        </p>
        <p>See: <a href="multi_edition_video.html">Multi-Edition Video</a> for details</p>
        <p>Besides the multi-edition (which can be triggered in a Ctrl+K search or with the mouse with
            Ctrl+Alt+Mouse Click), the rectangular edit is also improved to be triggered with
            Alt+Click (and stopped with escape).
        </p>
        <h3>Bundling of other useful plugins</h3>
        <p>Eclipse has a myriad of useful plugins, and LiClipse bundles some which are considered to be useful
            regardless of which language you're dealing with: Workspace Mechanic, Eclipse Color Theme, StartExplorer, AnyEdit and PyDev
            (note that PyDev does not follow the rule of being useful for everyone as the other plugins,
            but LiClipse itself reuses parts of the PyDev codebase).
