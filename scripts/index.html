        <h3>Release Highlights for LiClipse 3.0.1</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Based on <strong>Eclipse 4.6 M7</strong></li>
        	<li>Requires <strong>Java 8</strong> to run</li>
        	<li>Fixed scrollbar issue on Git Staging view</li>
        	<li>JavaScript editor using Nashorn instead of Rhino for JSHint and Beautify.js</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Note that JSHint doesn't officially support Nashorn, so, a patched version is needed.</li>
        		<li>Nashorn is <strong>much</strong> faster than Rhino, so, opening a big file to be linted should no longer halt the IDE.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Removed scrollbar theming from trees and tables due to some bugs (users that want can still enable it
        		by installing <a href="http://fappel.github.io/xiliary/clean-sheet.html">Xiliary</a> and enabling the related
        		setting at at General > Appearance > Color Theme).</li>
        	<li>Updated PyDev to 5.0.0</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Improvements in debugger, PyUnit view persist across restart, super() code completion and wrap expression deadlock fix.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Updated EGit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Release Highlights for LiClipse 2.5.4</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Updated PyDev to 4.5.5</li>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Improvements in code-completion, pytest integration, python 3 parsing, debugger and django tests running</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Accepting hyphen for tags/attributes in XML editor</li>
        	<li>Themed ScrollBar disabled by default for Trees/Tables (can be manually enabled at General > Appearance > Color Theme)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a href="history.html">View highlights for previous releases</a></p>
        <p>Supported languages feature syntax highlighting, template completion,
            outline, select/deselect scope, comment/uncomment, auto-indent, linked edition,
            multi-edition, mark occurrences, among others.
        </p>
        <p>As a note, some editors have <strong>improved support:</strong></p>
        <p>The HTML editor has advanced context-based code-completion</p>
        <p>The HTML, XML and JavaScript editors have code-analysis and code-formatting features</p>
        <h3>Usability improvements for all Eclipse editors</h3>
        <p>At this point, the major improvement is multi-edition and vertical indent guides, supporting all editors
            (such as PyDev, JDT, etc).
        </p>
        <p>See: <a href="multi_edition_video.html">Multi-Edition Video</a> for details</p>
        <p>Besides the multi-edition (which can be triggered in a Ctrl+K search or with the mouse with
            Ctrl+Alt+Mouse Click), the rectangular edit is also improved to be triggered with
            Alt+Click (and stopped with escape).
        </p>
        <h3>Bundling of other useful plugins</h3>
        <p>Eclipse has a myriad of useful plugins, and LiClipse bundles some which are considered to be useful
            regardless of which language you're dealing with: Eclipse Color Theme, StartExplorer, AnyEdit and PyDev
            (note that PyDev does not follow the rule of being useful for everyone as the other plugins,
            but LiClipse itself reuses parts of the PyDev codebase).
