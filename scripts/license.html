In short terms, the license alows anyone to evaluate LiClipse for 30 days, but it must be bought for continued use.<br/><br/>

A single-user license can be used only by the person to which it's licensed for.<br/> <br/>

A multi-user license is to be obtained by an organization so that its employess can use it.
It can be used by more than one person, but the number of developers using it within a week may not exceed the amount of users to which it was licensed for.
(i.e.: If licensed for 2 developers, if 2 developers use it on Monday, it cannot be used by anyone else until the next Monday).<br/><br/>

A license is bought for a given version of the software (i.e.: 1.0, 2.0) and must be renewed for use in a new version (but has no time-limit).
Eternal licenses (which were available only during the crowdfunding campaign) can be used for any version of the sofware.<br/><br/>
